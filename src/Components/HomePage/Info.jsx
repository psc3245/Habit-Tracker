        Hi, I'm Peter Collins, a senior at Iowa State University studying
        Computer Science with a minor in Cyber Security. I am builidng this app
        both as a personal project and because I wanted a habit tracking app and
        I never found one that had all the features I wanted. Since I know how
        to code, I figured I could just make my own!
